# Contexts

With Behat, it is possible to flexibly structure your code by using multiple contexts in a single test suite.

## Available contexts

The WordPress Extension for Behat includes the following contexts:

* _**RawWordpressContext**_
  A context that provides no step definitions, but all of the necessary functionality for interacting with WordPress, and with the browser, via Mink sessions.

* _**WordpressContext**_
  Provides step-definitions for creating TODO, TODO, and TODO.

* _**MessageContext**_
  Step-definitions that are specific to WordPress messages that get displayed (notice, warning, and error)
