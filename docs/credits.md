__Extra special thanks is extended to [Jonathan Hedstrom](https://github.com/jhedstrom) and his [Behat Drupal Extension](https://github.com/jhedstrom/drupalextension/) project. Much of the structure of this project is based on Jonathan's work, and this project is forever in its debt, having taken direct inspiration from its amazing technical architecture and innovative features (such as drivers).__

For making it straightforward to publish this documentation, the project would like to thank [Couscous](http://couscous.io). Couscous generates HTML from Markdown, and does it wonderfully.

Finally, thank you for considering WordHat. It is a tool built by developers for developers, and we hope it helps you achieve wonderful things.
