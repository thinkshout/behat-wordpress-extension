# Drivers

WordHat provides a range of drivers for interacting with the WordPress site you are testing. A driver represents and manages the connection between the Behat and WordPress environments. Different drivers support different features.

* The **WP-CLI** driver -- the default -- uses [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/) to communicate with WordPress.
* The **WordPress API** driver loads WordPress in the same PHP context as Behat.
* The **Blackbox** driver interacts with WordPress through a web browser, in an unpriviledged context.

To specify which driver to use for your tests, set [`default_driver`](settings.html) in your `behat.yml` file.
